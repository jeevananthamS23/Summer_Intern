🌐 What is DOM?
DOM stands for Document Object Model.

It is like a tree structure created by the browser when a webpage loads.
This tree is made from the HTML of the webpage.

Think of HTML like the skeleton of the page.

DOM is like a live copy of that skeleton which JavaScript can control.

📌 Purpose of DOM
The main purpose of the DOM is to:

✅ Let JavaScript access and change the content, structure, and style of a webpage.
✅ With DOM, JavaScript can:

Change text on the page.

Add or remove elements.

Change colors or styles.

React to user actions like clicking, typing, etc.

🔧 Why DOM is used in JavaScript?
Because JavaScript needs a way to "talk" to the webpage.

Without DOM:

JavaScript wouldn’t know what is on the page.

JavaScript couldn’t change anything on the page.

DOM makes this possible by giving access to each part of the HTML as an object.
