Port 80: Typically uses port 80 for communication. 

HTTPS:
Encrypted: Uses SSL/TLS encryption to secure the data transmitted between browser and server. 
Secure: Protects against eavesdropping and data tampering. 
Port 443: Typically uses port 443 for communication. 
Authentication: Verifies the identity of the website, ensuring you're connecting to the correct server.
